# OUFoodWaste
Static website for The Ohio University Food Waste Reduction Committee (OUFWRC).

For this assignment you will be assigned a partner and you will work with them to create your own environmental campaign/cause.
Your goal is to work in a multimodal/interdisciplinary environment and build an organization that advocates for a specific cause.

Your project must be tangible or visible and can be presented by: brochures, a blog, website, photography project, video ad campaign,
student organization, etc.

1. Things you must include/think about during your project:
What is your environmental issue/conservation project and why are you promoting it?
The Ohio University Food Waste Reduction Committee (OUFWRC). Our committee is striving to reduce food waste coming from
the Ohio University dining halls.

2.What is your mission statement?
Food waste and hunger are both prevalent issues on campus – neither needs to exist. OUFWRC strives to ensure food resources
are distributed effectively to reduce waste and keep each student nourished.

3.Who is your target audience? How is this reflected in your project?
We hope to affect the lives of every person who uses the dining halls: students, professors, faculty, and visitors will all
benefit from the improved services provided as result.

4.What rhetorical choices are made? Are you being serious, promoting it in an amusing way, using fear tactics?
Our organization benefits from the seriousness of the issue at hand. Nobody likes to see food go to waste, and we all know how
prevalent the problem of hunger is worldwide. By providing effective ways to manage both, we believe most of the campus can get
behind our movement.

5.What kind of platform? Is it a campaign, a challenge, and awareness group, a political issue?
It is a longer term process that has multiple parts. First, we must market ourselves to students to make them aware of their dining
choices. With a buffet style cafeteria, students often take far more food than necessary, and end up wasting it. Next, we must find
an effective way measure the amount of food being wasted in proportion to the amount produced. This way, we can estimate the full
extent of the issue, as well as monitor our progress over time. With hard data, we can pressure the University treasury to examine
the cost effectiveness of their current dining plans, by informing students of how much money they are spending on wasted food. In
the end, we hope to either reduce meal plan costs by encouraging the university to only buy food that will not be wasted, or change
the dining hall experience entirely to a made-to-order process.

6.How are you going to share this mission? Are you presenting it in a digital environment? How are you reaching the maximum amount
of people?
Luckily, a vast majority of undergraduates will step into dining halls. Physical handouts and posters can be effectively used,
reminding students on the spot to examine their choices. A digital presence, however, will be the key to our strategy. By providing
eye popping stats, a sense of urgency, and informing students of the direct costs they are accruing, our digital presence should prove
our most effective growth platform.

7.Are you giving away something/selling something to promote this mission?
No. Posters and signage should be enough – hopefully the long term effects will give back to the students more than enough.

8.What other organizations share this mission? (This is the research element of your project. Where are you getting your factual
information from? What is your claim and evidence for your project?)
